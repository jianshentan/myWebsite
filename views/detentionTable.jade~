        <em> This is a detention table. It is <b>designed for the exclusive use of only the naughty children</b>. The structure requires the wall which it leans on and forces detained students to face the wall and reflect upon the naughtiness of which they have been detained for. The thin seat is also designed to reduce comfort to discourage students from wanting to use the table and consequently to <b> encourage children to stay well-behaved</b>. Despite this, the table maintains key features of academic furniture (at least features key to our age of technology). The 17 inch distance between the table top and the seat forces students into an uncomfortably good-for-computer-use posture (forces wrist to not be at angles and straight back).Â </em>
