        div.summary In this game, the player encounters dead bodies that look identical to himself. As he makes his way up, with the intention of rescuing the princess, he discovers more about these dead bodies, who they are and how they've died. While the player learns about previous attempts to climb the tower, the gamer, separate from the player, contemplates their experience playing the game. The gamer is confronted with an ambiguous point of entry and ghosts who entertain the idea of there being other players in the same game. Concurrently, the game draws from conventional gaming elements (such as battles, collecting items, character growth) to create the expectation of death. Ironically, the player, surrounded by death (and ghosts) and the expectation of death, is unable to die (at least not until the end). This separates gameplay (the gamer's "death") from content (the player's encounters with death) and changes it from being a consequence of gameplay to the subject of the game.
